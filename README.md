# NEOs-Project
# 1. Data Cleaning
The goal of data Cleaning is To prepare it and make it ready for analysis or model training, The benefit of that step is that Cleaned data results in more accurate analysis and models.

# 2.Data Visualization
This step has been done to gain a better understanding of the dataset and uncover patterns, trends, or relationships between features.
## - Hazardous vs. Non-Hazardous NEOs:
A count plot was used to visualize the class imbalance in the target variable (is_hazardous)
## - Distribution of NEO Relative Velocity:
visualization of the distribution of the relative velocity of NEOs (relative_velocity_km_s), This helped identify the common speed ranges at which NEOs travel.
